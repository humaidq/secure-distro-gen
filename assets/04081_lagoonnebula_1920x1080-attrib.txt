Lagoon Nebula

October 25th, 2016

Taken from Gornergrad, a rocky ridge of the Pennine Alps, overlooking the
Gorner Glacier south-east of Zermatt in Switzerland.

I was like standing there and then like woah, all of a sudden there was this
cloud reaching out and then it was like lit from below and I was like SNAP boom
into my camera.

Moon for lighting, Photoshop, Manfrotto tripod, gloves.

Nikon D800, Nikon AF-S NIKKOR 14-24mm f/2.8G ED.

Photo Settings: 19mm, f/2, 25 seconds, ISO 100.
